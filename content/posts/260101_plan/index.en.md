# Looking Back on 2025

In July and November 2024, my ulcerative colitis worsened to the point where there were no more treatment options available, leading to two surgeries to remove my entire colon. I needed time to recover, so I left my first company at the end of January 2025. Though I learned a lot during those 2 years and 2 months and had many regrets, that chapter came to a close.

Having worked part-time jobs and full-time since my student days, it felt awkward and anxiety-inducing at first to just rest at home without doing anything. However, I gradually adapted. While the aftermath of the surgery prevented me from doing anything active, I was able to play games I wanted to and heal from the mental struggles I had been through.

Looking back, even during my recovery period, I obtained certifications for the Information Processing Engineer and SQLD, and continued working on side projects to maintain my programming skills. (I guess I just can't completely rest and do nothing...)

2025 can be summarized with two words: 'resignation' and 'recovery'. There were many difficult times due to poor health, but I want to praise myself for enduring it all.

# Plans for 2026

As the new year begins, I've recovered significantly and am preparing to return to work. My areas of interest are the financial sector or e-commerce domain, and I'm preparing accordingly.

While the future is always uncertain, I believe that good opportunities will come with steady preparation.
