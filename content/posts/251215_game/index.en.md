I found an interesting game on Steam and wanted to share it. 😂

**The Farmer Was Replaced** is a game where you have a drone that you control by writing Python code to automate crop farming. lol 😂

The game actually explains Python syntax pretty well, so it might not be a bad way for Python beginners to learn while having fun?

I haven't enabled Korean mode yet so it's showing in English, but it seems to support Korean as well..!

When I first started playing, I was confused because I couldn't even declare variables. But turns out you need to unlock functions, variables, etc. by spending resources earned from farming crops...

It's pretty addictive, and the core content seems to be implementing optimized algorithms to expand your farm, plant crops, and harvest them at the right timing as they grow.

As of today, it's 20% off on Steam, so if you're interested (developers?), I'd recommend giving it a try...? 😄
