Examples used for detailed explanation were generated with the help of AI.\nRFC 6455 (The WebSocket Protocol) # The goal of the WebSocket protocol is to provide a mechanism for browser-based applications that need bidirectional communication with a server, without relying on multiple HTTP connections (e.g., XMLHttpRequest, long polling). WebSocket is composed of an initial handshake followed by basic message framing over TCP.\nIn the past, applications that needed bidirectional communication between a client and a server often “abused” HTTP: they polled for server updates and then sent notifications via separate HTTP calls on top of that (RFC 6202).\nOne way to solve this is to use a single TCP connection for bidirectional traffic. WebSocket supports this approach. WebSocket API spec: https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org/\nWebSocket was designed to replace bidirectional communication techniques that used HTTP as a transport layer in order to benefit from existing infrastructure such as proxies, filtering, and authentication. Existing techniques were implemented as compromises between efficiency and reliability, because HTTP was not originally built for bidirectional communication.\nThe WebSocket protocol attempts to address the goals of existing bidirectional HTTP techniques within HTTP infrastructure environments. So it is designed to work over ports 80 and 443, and to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries—even if that adds complexity in today’s environment.\nThat said, this design does not limit WebSocket to HTTP. The spec notes that future implementations could use a simpler handshake over a dedicated port without reinventing the entire protocol.\nThe document emphasizes this because the traffic patterns of interactive messaging often do not resemble standard HTTP traffic, which can cause abnormal load on some infrastructure components.\nProtocol Overview # The WebSocket protocol consists of two parts: the handshake and data transfer.\n// Client handshake request GET /chat HTTP/1.1 Host: server.example.com Upgrade: websocket Connection: Upgrade Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ== Origin: http://example.com Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13 // Server handshake response HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols Upgrade: websocket Connection: Upgrade Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo= Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat The client follows the Request-Line format and the server follows the Status-Line format. (RFC 2616)\nOnce both sides send the handshake and it succeeds, data transfer begins. This is a bidirectional communication channel where each side can send data independently, without waiting for the other side to “request” it.\nNow the client and server exchange data in units called “messages” in the WebSocket spec.\nA WebSocket message may not map 1:1 to frames at a particular network layer. The reason is that intermediate devices can coalesce fragmented messages or do the opposite (split them further).\nEach frame that belongs to the same message contains the same type of data. Broadly, there are textual data, binary data, and control frames (not application data; e.g., protocol-level signaling such as closing the connection).\nThe WebSocket protocol defines six frame types and reserves ten for future use.\nOpcode Type Name Description 0x0 Data Continuation Continuation of the previous frame’s payload 0x1 Data Text UTF-8 text data 0x2 Data Binary Binary data 0x3~0x7 Data Reserved Reserved for future data frame extensions (5) 0x8 Control Close Request to close the connection 0x9 Control Ping Heartbeat / liveness check 0xA Control Pong Response to Ping 0xB~0xF Control Reserved Reserved for future control frame extensions (5) “A fragmented message can be coalesced, or the opposite can happen” # That line can be confusing, so here’s an example.\nFirst, why does fragmentation happen? Common reasons include:\nMTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) limits (network packet size limit, typically ~1500 bytes) Packets larger than the MTU may be split into smaller pieces on the path (fragmented). Think of it like a height limit in a tunnel.\nThe server may be configured to send in chunks of a specific size.\nSimilar to (1): intermediaries such as proxies, load balancers, or API gateways may split large frames.\nMemory efficiency: splitting avoids buffering a huge payload all at once.\nBack to the main point—let’s look at both coalescing and splitting.\n1. Coalesced (original: sent in fragments) [Frame 1: FIN=0, opcode=text, \u0026#34;Hello \u0026#34;] [Frame 2: FIN=0, opcode=continuation, \u0026#34;World\u0026#34;] [Frame 3: FIN=1, opcode=continuation, \u0026#34;!\u0026#34;] (an intermediary receives the three frames and forwards them as one) [Frame: FIN=1, opcode=text, \u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;] 2. Split (original) [Frame: FIN=1, \u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;] (an intermediary splits the original frame) [Frame 1: FIN=0, \u0026#34;Hello \u0026#34;] [Frame 2: FIN=1, \u0026#34;World!\u0026#34;] As another example, assume we have a Spring Boot service (acting as a client) receiving real-time stock data via WebSocket from a financial server (acting as the server). Let’s walk through it.\nAssume the financial server sends a single message split across multiple frames (and they are not coalesced in the middle): [WebSocket Frame 1] FIN: 0 (not done yet) Opcode: 0x1 (text) Payload: {\u0026#34;stockCode\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;005930\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;price\u0026#34;:71500,\u0026#34;vol [WebSocket Frame 2] FIN: 0 (not done yet) Opcode: 0x0 (continuation) Payload: ume\u0026#34;:50000,\u0026#34;time\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;09:00:01\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;seller\u0026#34;:\u0026#34; [WebSocket Frame 3] FIN: 1 (this is the last) Opcode: 0x0 (continuation) Payload: foreign\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;buyer\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;institution\u0026#34;,...} @Component public class WebSocketHandler extends TextWebSocketHandler { @Override protected void handleTextMessage(WebSocketSession session, TextMessage message) { // message.getPayload() is already a complete message here // You receive the full payload: {\u0026#34;stockCode\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;005930\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;price\u0026#34;:71500,\u0026#34;volume\u0026#34;:50000,...} String payload = message.getPayload(); } } The reason payload is a complete message is that Spring buffers Frame 1 and 2 (because FIN=0), concatenates them, and when it sees Frame 3 with FIN=1, it combines the buffered data and then invokes handleTextMessage().\nOne thing I felt while studying this is that, because frameworks implement so many things so well for us, it’s easy to ship features without really understanding what’s happening at the network level.\nTo summarize the “big picture” of the WebSocket protocol so far:\nIt consists of two parts: Handshake and Data Transfer. After the handshake succeeds, the connection becomes bidirectional and data transfer happens. Data is exchanged as a unit called a message. A message may not match a specific network-layer frame, because intermediaries can split or coalesce it. WebSocket defines 16 opcodes total: 3 data frames + 3 control frames + 5 reserved data + 5 reserved control. Next, let’s look at how the Opening Handshake works.\nOpening Handshake # Header Purpose Upgrade Request protocol upgrade Connection Request connection upgrade Sec-WebSocket-Key Security key (Base64-encoded random 16 bytes) Sec-WebSocket-Version Protocol version (currently 13) Sec-WebSocket-Protocol Subprotocol (optional) Origin Origin info sent by the browser The initial handshake is designed to be compatible with HTTP-based servers and intermediaries, so that both HTTP clients and WebSocket clients can use a single port to talk to the same server. Therefore, the WebSocket client’s handshake is an HTTP Upgrade request.\nHeader fields in the handshake can be sent in any order, so the order in which different header fields are received is not important. The client includes the host name in the Host header field so that both the client and server can confirm they agree on the host being used.\nAdditional header fields are used to select options in the WebSocket protocol. Common options include a subprotocol selector (Sec-WebSocket-Protocol), the list of extensions the client supports (Sec-WebSocket-Extensions), and the Origin field. The Sec-WebSocket-Protocol request header indicates subprotocols (application-level protocols layered on top of WebSocket) that the client is willing to use. The server may select one of the acceptable protocols—or none—and it echoes the selected value in the handshake response.\n// Client handshake request GET /chat HTTP/1.1 Host: server.example.com Upgrade: websocket Connection: Upgrade Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ== Origin: http://example.com Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat, superchat Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13 // Server handshake response HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols Upgrade: websocket Connection: Upgrade Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo= Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat \u0026lt;- the server echoes the protocol it selected When the server receives the client’s handshake, it must include two key pieces of information in the response. The first is Sec-WebSocket-Accept.\nHow to compute Sec-WebSocket-Accept # The Sec-WebSocket-Accept field indicates whether the server is willing to accept the WebSocket connection.\nTake Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ== Concatenate: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ== + 258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11 Compute SHA-1 hash: 0xb3 0x7a 0x4f 0x2c 0xc0 0x62 0x4f 0x16 0x90 0xf6 0x46 0x06 0xcf 0x38 0x59 0x45 0xb2 0xbe 0xc4 0xea Base64 encode: \u0026quot;s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=\u0026quot; Include Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo= in the response By returning Sec-WebSocket-Accept and status code 101, the server tells the client it accepted the handshake.\n// If the server accepts the client\u0026#39;s handshake and the connection is established normally, the status code is 101. // Any status code other than 101 means the WebSocket handshake did not complete. HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols Based on this response, the client checks that Sec-WebSocket-Accept matches the expected value, required header fields are present, and the HTTP status code is 101. If any of these checks fail, no WebSocket frames are sent.\nTo recap:\nThe handshake begins as an HTTP protocol upgrade request. Header order does not matter. The server response must include Sec-WebSocket-Accept computed from Sec-WebSocket-Key, along with HTTP status 101. Next, let’s look at how a WebSocket connection is closed.\nClosing Handshake # WebSocket also uses a handshake-style process when closing the connection.\nOne side sends a control frame indicating close. The other side responds with a close control frame. After both sides have sent and received a close frame, the TCP connection is closed. The reason WebSocket uses its own closing handshake is to complement the TCP closing handshake (FIN/ACK). If there are intercepting proxies or other intermediaries, TCP closing handshake signals are not always reliably end-to-end, according to the spec.\nWhat does “not reliably end-to-end” mean here? Using the TCP closing handshake (4-way handshake) can lead to data loss.\n// TCP Closing handshake Client Server | | |-------- FIN -----------\u0026gt;| \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m done sending\u0026#34; |\u0026lt;------- ACK ------------| \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34; |\u0026lt;------- FIN ------------| \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m done too\u0026#34; |-------- ACK -----------\u0026gt;| \u0026#34;OK\u0026#34; | | The core issue described is that with intermediaries (proxies, load balancers), TCP close may not propagate end-to-end as expected.\nLet’s look at an example if you rely only on the TCP closing handshake.\nHere’s a quick reference for flags:\nFlag Purpose When used SYN Start connection Start 3-way handshake ACK Acknowledge receipt Included in most packets FIN Graceful close When no more data to send RST Abort / reset Error cases, abnormal close // Reproducing a scenario: the client closes the socket while the stock server is still sending data. // Stock Server side session.sendMessage(new TextMessage(stockData1)); // delivered session.sendMessage(new TextMessage(stockData2)); // delivered, but the client hasn\u0026#39;t read it yet // Client side - suddenly closes the socket socket.close(); // stockData2 is still in the receive queue when closing What happens at the OS level:\n[Client receive queue] +----------------------+ | stockData2 (unread) | ← the app hasn\u0026#39;t consumed it yet +----------------------+ socket.close() is called ↓ OS: \u0026#34;You want to close with unread data still pending?\u0026#34; ↓ OS sends an RST packet (instead of a graceful FIN) ↓ Stock Server receives RST ↓ Stock Server\u0026#39;s recv() fails (Connection reset by peer) RST vs FIN # FIN: \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m done. Let\u0026#39;s close cleanly.\u0026#34; RST: \u0026#34;Emergency! Reset the connection—something went wrong!\u0026#34; When the stock server receives an RST:\nIt discards any remaining data it was about to send. It logs errors. Connection state becomes harder to reason about. At this point you might wonder: doesn’t the same issue apply to HTTP request/response too?\nYes, the same issue can happen. But it usually doesn’t matter much:\nThe request/response is already complete. The connection is short-lived. The next request can use a new connection. HTTP example Client Proxy Server │ │ │ │── GET /stock ─────────\u0026gt;│── GET /stock ─────────\u0026gt;│ │ │ │ │\u0026lt;── 200 OK + data ──────│\u0026lt;── 200 OK + data ──────│ │ │ │ │── FIN ────────────────\u0026gt;│ │ │ │ (may or may not forward) │ │ │ HTTP is stateless, and once a request/response ends, the connection’s job is done—so an abnormal close is typically not a big deal.\nWebSocket example Client Proxy Server │ │ │ │══ WebSocket connection (persistent) ════════════│ │ │ │ │\u0026lt;── stockData1 ─────────│\u0026lt;── stockData1 ─────────│ │\u0026lt;── stockData2 ─────────│\u0026lt;── stockData2 ─────────│ │\u0026lt;── stockData3 ─────────│\u0026lt;── stockData3 ─────────│ │ ... │ ... │ │ │ │ │── FIN ────────────────\u0026gt;│ │ │ │ (not forwarded) │ │ │ │ │ │\u0026lt;── stockData4 ─────────│ ← server keeps sending! │ │\u0026lt;── stockData5 ─────────│ │ │\u0026lt;── stockData6 ─────────│ │ │ │ │ │ buffered in proxy │ │ │ or lost somewhere │ But WebSocket is stateful and the connection stays open while data flows continuously, so this becomes a real problem.\nThat’s why WebSocket closes via its own handshake. The close frame is an application-layer message that intermediaries must forward. Unlike TCP FIN, a proxy cannot arbitrarily handle it.\nClient Proxy Server │ │ │ │── Close Frame ────────\u0026gt;│── Close Frame ────────\u0026gt;│ ← application level │ │ │ │ │ Server: \u0026#34;closing\u0026#34; │ │ │ unsubscribe │ │ │ stop sending │ │ │ │ │\u0026lt;── Close Frame ────────│\u0026lt;── Close Frame ────────│ │ │ │ │── FIN ────────────────\u0026gt;│── FIN ────────────────\u0026gt;│ ← then TCP closes WebSocket design philosophy: minimal framing # Core principle # RFC 6455 states WebSocket’s design principle like this:\n\u0026ldquo;The WebSocket Protocol is designed on the principle that there should be minimal framing\u0026rdquo;\nThe framing WebSocket provides is for exactly two purposes:\nStream → message conversion: TCP is a continuous byte stream, but applications think in “messages” Text vs binary distinction: whether a payload is UTF-8 text or arbitrary binary All other metadata (message type, routing, authentication, etc.) is intentionally left to the application layer.\nThe TCP problem: no message boundaries # TCP is a byte-stream protocol. Data flows continuously like water through a pipe; there’s no notion of “this is the end of a message.”\nSender: send(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;) send(\u0026#34;World\u0026#34;) Inside the TCP pipe: [H][e][l][l][o][W][o][r][l][d] ← all contiguous What the receiver may actually get: recv() → \u0026#34;Hel\u0026#34; recv() → \u0026#34;loWor\u0026#34; recv() → \u0026#34;ld\u0026#34; The receiver can’t tell where “Hello” ends and “World” begins.\nWebSocket’s solution: restore boundaries with frames # WebSocket wraps each message in frames to define boundaries:\nSender: ws.send(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;) ws.send(\u0026#34;World\u0026#34;) After WebSocket framing: [FIN=1, len=5, \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;][FIN=1, len=5, \u0026#34;World\u0026#34;] ├─── Frame 1 ───────┤├─── Frame 2 ────────┤ Receiver: onMessage(\u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34;) ← receives exactly the original message units onMessage(\u0026#34;World\u0026#34;) What “minimal” means # This is all the information that appears in the WebSocket frame header:\nField Purpose FIN Whether this is the last frame of the message Opcode Text (0x1) vs Binary (0x2) vs Control (0x8, 0x9, 0xA) Length Payload length Mask Whether masking is used (security) Compared to HTTP headers, the difference is obvious:\nHTTP headers (hundreds of bytes): Content-Type: application/json Content-Length: 42 Authorization: Bearer xxx X-Request-ID: abc123 Cache-Control: no-cache ... and so on WebSocket frame header (2~14 bytes): [FIN + opcode][MASK + length] That\u0026#39;s it. What WebSocket does not do # The “minimal framing” philosophy also means: everything else is your job.\nExample of an actual client message: { \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;SUBSCRIBE\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;channel\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;stock.005930\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;userId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;gun0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;token\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;abc123\u0026#34; } What WebSocket knows:\n\u0026ldquo;This is a text frame and its length is 120 bytes.\u0026rdquo; What WebSocket doesn’t know:\nWhat type means How to route by channel How to authenticate/authorize using userId and token All of that must be implemented by the application layer.\nWhy you use subprotocols like STOMP # With plain WebSocket only:\n@OnMessage public void onMessage(String message) { // message is just a string // you must parse it and implement routing / semantics yourself JSONObject json = new JSONObject(message); String type = json.getString(\u0026#34;type\u0026#34;); if (type.equals(\u0026#34;SUBSCRIBE\u0026#34;)) { // implement subscribe logic } else if (type.equals(\u0026#34;UNSUBSCRIBE\u0026#34;)) { // implement unsubscribe logic } else if (type.equals(\u0026#34;SEND\u0026#34;)) { // implement message sending logic } } If you layer STOMP on top:\n@MessageMapping(\u0026#34;/stock/{stockCode}\u0026#34;) public void handleStock(@DestinationVariable String stockCode, StockRequest request) { // message type and routing are already handled } What WebSocket adds on top of TCP # RFC 6455 clearly defines WebSocket’s role:\n1. Web Origin-based security model # Origin: http://example.com In browser environments, this tells the server “where the script came from,” giving the server a basis to reject cross-origin requests.\n2. Addressing and protocol naming # GET /chat HTTP/1.1 Host: server.example.com Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: stomp, mqtt You can provide multiple services on a single IP + port:\nDistinguish endpoints via path (/chat, /notifications) Virtual hosting via the Host header Negotiate subprotocols via Sec-WebSocket-Protocol 3. Framing mechanism # The RFC uses an interesting phrasing:\n\u0026ldquo;layers a framing mechanism on top of TCP to get back to the IP packet mechanism that TCP is built on, but without length limits\u0026rdquo;\nLayer Property IP Packet-based, clear boundaries, size limits (~1500 bytes) TCP Stream-based, no boundaries, no size limits WebSocket Frame-based, clear boundaries, no size limits TCP stitches IP packets together into a continuous stream, and WebSocket restores application-level message boundaries.\n4. Proxy-friendly Closing Handshake # TCP FIN/ACK alone can cause data loss when a proxy is involved:\n[Client] ----data----\u0026gt; [Proxy] ----data----\u0026gt; [Server] [Client] \u0026lt;---FIN------ [Proxy] [Server] ← proxy may cut off independently WebSocket Close frames negotiate closure at the application layer, which is safer:\n[Client] ---Close Frame---\u0026gt; [Proxy] ---Close Frame---\u0026gt; [Server] [Client] \u0026lt;--Close Frame---- [Proxy] \u0026lt;--Close Frame---- [Server] [Client] -------TCP FIN-------\u0026gt; ... -------TCP FIN-------\u0026gt; [Server] “As close to raw TCP as possible” # A key sentence from the RFC:\n\u0026ldquo;Basically it is intended to be as close to just exposing raw TCP to script as possible given the constraints of the Web.\u0026rdquo;\nBrowsers cannot allow JavaScript to open raw TCP sockets directly (for security reasons). WebSocket aims to provide an experience as close to TCP as possible within those constraints.\nWhat WebSocket does not add:\nFeature Why Message IDs Up to the application Request-response mapping It’s a bidirectional stream Retransmission / ordering TCP already provides this Compression Raw by default (possible via extensions) Authentication Typically handled in the HTTP handshake Routing Typically handled by a subprotocol Coexisting with HTTP infrastructure # \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s also designed in such a way that its servers can share a port with HTTP servers\u0026rdquo;\nThis is a very practical design decision:\nPort 80/443 │ ├── GET /api/users HTTP/1.1 → handled as normal HTTP ├── GET /index.html HTTP/1.1 → handled as normal HTTP └── GET /ws HTTP/1.1 → WebSocket upgrade Upgrade: websocket Benefits:\nCan pass through existing load balancers, proxies, and firewalls No need to open extra ports Can share TLS certificates This is why the handshake takes the form of an HTTP Upgrade request. The RFC also mentions:\n\u0026ldquo;the design does not limit WebSocket to HTTP, and future implementations could use a simpler handshake over a dedicated port without reinventing the entire protocol\u0026rdquo;\nIn other words, HTTP compatibility is a choice for today’s web infrastructure, not the essence of the protocol.\nExtensibility # \u0026ldquo;The protocol is intended to be extensible; future versions will likely introduce additional concepts such as multiplexing.\u0026rdquo;\nReserved for extensions:\nReserved item Purpose RSV1, RSV2, RSV3 bits Per-frame extension flags Opcode 0x3-0x7 Additional data frame types Opcode 0xB-0xF Additional control frame types Sec-WebSocket-Extensions header Extension negotiation A real-world extension example — permessage-deflate:\nSec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-deflate; client_max_window_bits This is a message compression extension; it uses the RSV1 bit to mark “this frame is compressed.”\nAnalogy # TCP = a highway\nCars (bytes) keep flowing No clear boundary lines showing where one “group” ends and the next begins WebSocket = container trucks\nGoods (messages) are packed into containers (frames) The truck doesn’t know what’s inside; it just carries the container safely It only needs minimal info like container size STOMP = a logistics system\nAdds manifests: “this goes to A, that goes to B” Categorizes goods by type Adds tracking and routing WebSocket is like the container truck: it delivers payloads safely as chunks, while higher-level protocols such as STOMP manage what’s inside.\nSummary # WebSocket’s design philosophy can be summarized as: “do the minimum, delegate the rest.”\nWhat WebSocket does What WebSocket doesn’t do Define message boundaries Message types / routing Distinguish text vs binary Auth / authorization Keep the connection alive Reconnect logic Ping/Pong heartbeat Business logic Origin-based security basis Application-level security Because of this philosophy, WebSocket is lightweight and general-purpose. You can layer STOMP, Socket.IO, or your own custom protocol on top depending on your needs.\nThat’s what I learned from reading RFC 6455 and digging into how WebSocket works.

(RFC 6455)","type":"posts"},{"content":" Introduction # While working on a mock investment project, I needed to serve real-time stock price fluctuation data and ended up using WebSocket technology. I\u0026rsquo;ve known about WebSocket, a bidirectional real-time communication technology, for some time, but never dug deep into it. I took this opportunity to dive in thoroughly.\nWhile reading RFC 6455, the WebSocket technical document, I found a section that referenced RFC 6202 (Known Issues and Best Practices for the Use of Long Polling and Streaming in Bidirectional HTTP) to explain past processing methods and their problems. Today, I\u0026rsquo;ll read RFC 6202 to learn how bidirectional communication was handled before WebSocket emerged, and explore the thoughts and best practices of that time.\nRFC 6202 (Known Issues and Best Practices for the Use of Long Polling and Streaming in Bidirectional HTTP) # This document, written in April 2011, discusses HTTP long polling and HTTP streaming as well-known issues and best practices for bidirectional HTTP communication at that time. It also acknowledges that both HTTP long polling and HTTP streaming are extensions of HTTP, and that the HTTP protocol was not designed for bidirectional communication. The authors note that this document neither recommends using these two methods nor discourages their use, but rather focuses on discussing good use cases and issues.\nFundamentally, HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol: RFC 2616) is a request/response protocol. HTTP defines three entities: clients, proxies, and servers. A client creates a connection to send an HTTP request to a server, and the server accepts the connection to process the HTTP request by returning a response. Proxies are objects that can intervene in forwarding requests and responses between clients and servers.\nBy default, the standard HTTP model doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow servers to send asynchronous events to clients because servers cannot initiate connections to clients first and cannot send unsolicited HTTP responses.\nSo to receive asynchronous events as quickly as possible, clients must periodically poll the server. This continuous polling forces request/response cycles even when there\u0026rsquo;s no data, consuming network resources and reducing application response efficiency as data queues up until the server receives the next polling request.\nHTTP long polling \u0026amp; HTTP streaming # 1. HTTP long polling # Traditional short polling is a technique where clients periodically send requests to the server to update data, but they receive empty responses even when there are no new events, or must wait until the next poll. This technique\u0026rsquo;s request cycle is determined by the delay time set by the client, and when this cycle is short (high polling frequency), it can cause unbearable burden on both server and network.\nIn contrast, long polling attempts to minimize message delivery delays and network resource usage by responding to requests only when specific events, states, or network timeouts occur.\nHTTP long polling life cycle # Client creates an initial request and waits for a response Server withholds response until updates are available or a specific state or timeout occurs When updates become available, server sends a response to the client Immediately after receiving the response, client either creates a new long poll request right away or after an acceptable delay HTTP long polling issues # Header overhead: Since every request/response is an HTTP message, HTTP headers always accompany it even if the data is small. For small data, headers can constitute a significant portion of data transmission. If the network MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) can accommodate all information including headers in a single IP packet, the network burden isn\u0026rsquo;t significant. However, when small messages are frequently exchanged, the problem of transmission volume being large relative to actual data occurs. For example, it\u0026rsquo;s like sending a single sheet of paper (20g) in a delivery box (300g).\nMaximal latency: Even if the server wants to immediately send a new message right after sending a long poll response, it must wait until the client\u0026rsquo;s next request arrives. Average latency is close to 1 network transit, but in the worst case can extend up to 3 network transits (response-request-response), and considering TCP packet loss retransmission, even more can occur.\nConnection Establishment: Both short polling and long polling are criticized for frequently opening and closing TCP/IP connections. However, both polling mechanisms work well with persistent HTTP connections that can be reused.\nAllocated Resources: Operating systems allocate resources to TCP/IP connections and pending HTTP requests. HTTP long polling requires both TCP/IP connections and HTTP requests to remain open for each client. Therefore, when determining the scale of an HTTP long polling application, it\u0026rsquo;s important to consider resources related to both.\nGraceful Degradation: When servers or clients are overloaded, messages can queue up and multiple messages can be bundled in one response. Latency increases but per-message overhead decreases, naturally distributing the load.\nTimeouts: Long poll requests can have timeout issues because they must maintain a hanging state until the server has data to send.\nCaching: If intermediate proxies or CDNs cache responses, the problem of receiving old data instead of fresh data can occur. While clients or hosts have no way to inform HTTP intermediaries that long polling is in use, caching that could interfere with bidirectional flow can be controlled with standard headers or cookies. As a best practice, caching should always be intentionally suppressed in long polling requests or responses. Set the \u0026ldquo;Cache-Control\u0026rdquo; header to \u0026ldquo;no-cache\u0026rdquo;.\n2. HTTP Streaming # The mechanism of HTTP streaming is to never terminate the request or disconnect the connection even after the server sends data to the client. This mechanism significantly reduces network latency because clients and servers don\u0026rsquo;t need to continuously initiate and disconnect connections.\nHTTP Streaming life cycle # Client creates an initial request and waits for a response Server withholds response until updates are available or a specific state or timeout occurs When updates become available, server sends a response to the client After sending data, server continues step 3 without terminating the request or disconnecting HTTP Streaming issues # Network Intermediaries: The HTTP protocol allows intermediaries (proxies, transparent proxies, gateways, etc.) to intervene in the process of transmitting responses from server to client. HTTP Streaming doesn\u0026rsquo;t work with these intermediaries.\nMaximal Latency: Theoretically 1 network transit, but in practice, connections must be periodically disconnected and reconnected to prevent unlimited growth in memory usage related to Javascript/DOM elements. Ultimately, like long polling, maximum latency is 3 network transits.\nClient Buffering: According to HTTP specifications, there\u0026rsquo;s no obligation to process partial responses immediately. While most browsers execute response JS, some only execute after buffer overflow occurs. Sending blank characters to fill the buffer can be used as a method.\nFraming Techniques: When using HTTP Streaming, multiple application messages can be transmitted in a single HTTP response. However, because intermediate objects like proxies can re-chunk chunk units, messages cannot be distinguished by chunk units. Therefore, separators must be separately defined at the application level. Long polling doesn\u0026rsquo;t have this problem because there\u0026rsquo;s one message per response.\nOther server-push mechanisms # Besides the two mechanisms above, this section introduces Bayeux (4.1), BOSH (4.2), Server-Sent Events (4.3), etc. It covers recommendations when using the SSE mechanism, as follows:\nThe specification recommends disabling HTTP chunking. The reason is the same as the HTTP streaming issues explained above.\nIntermediate proxies can re-chunk chunks Some proxies can buffer entire responses Best Practices # Summary # Item Key Content Recommendation Connection Limit 6-8 per browser limit Use one for long poll, detect duplicates with cookies Pipelining Regular requests can get blocked behind long poll Check support before use, prepare fallback Proxies Starvation occurs when connections are shared Use async proxies, avoid connection sharing Timeouts Too high gets 408/504, too low wastes traffic 30 seconds recommended Caching Real-time data shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be cached Cache-Control: no-cache mandatory Security Vulnerable to Injection, DoS Input validation, connection limit 1. Limits to the Maximum Number of Connections # Background # The HTTP specification (RFC 2616) originally recommended that a single client maintain a maximum of 2 connections to a server. There are two reasons:\nPrevent server overload Prevent unexpected side effects in congested networks Recent browsers have increased this limit to 6-8, but limits still exist. The problem is that users quickly exhaust these connections when opening multiple tabs or frames.\nWhy is this a problem? # Long polling occupies connections for a long time. If 3 tabs each open 2 long polls:\nTab 1: 2 long poll connections Tab 2: 2 long poll connections Tab 3: 2 long poll connections ───────────────────── Total 6 connections → Browser limit reached In this state, to send regular HTTP requests (images, API calls, etc.), you must wait until existing connections end. This is called connection starvation.\nRecommendations # Client side:\nIdeally, limit long poll requests to one and have multiple tabs/frames share it However, sharing resources between tabs is difficult due to browser security models (Same-Origin Policy, etc.) Server side:\nMust use cookies to detect duplicate long poll requests from the same browser When duplicate requests are detected, don\u0026rsquo;t make both wait—immediately respond to one to release it [Wrong handling] Request 1: Waiting... Request 2: Waiting... ← Both waiting causes connection starvation [Correct handling] Request 1: Waiting... Request 2: Arrives → Immediately send empty response to Request 1 → Only Request 2 waits 2. Pipelined Connections # What is pipelining? # A feature supported in HTTP/1.1 that allows sending multiple requests consecutively without waiting for responses.\n[Without pipelining] Request 1 → Response 1 → Request 2 → Response 2 → Request 3 → Response 3 [With pipelining] Request 1 → Request 2 → Request 3 → Response 1 → Response 2 → Response 3 Advantages in Long Polling # Useful when the server needs to send multiple messages in a short time. With pipelining, the server doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to wait for the client\u0026rsquo;s new request after responding. Requests are already queued.\nProblem: Regular requests get blocked # There\u0026rsquo;s a critical problem with pipelining. If a regular request gets queued behind a long poll, it must wait until the long poll ends.\n[Pipeline queue] 1. Long poll request (waiting 30 seconds...) 2. Image request ← Wait until long poll ends 3. API request ← Wait until long poll ends This can delay page loading by 30 seconds.\nPrecautions # HTTP POST pipelining is not recommended in RFC 2616 Protocols like BOSH or Bayeux pipeline POSTs while guaranteeing order with request IDs To use pipelining, must verify that clients, intermediate equipment, and servers all support it If not supported, must fallback to non-pipelined method 3. Proxies # Compatibility with general proxies # Long Polling: Works well with most proxies. Because it ultimately sends a complete HTTP response (when events occur or timeout).\nHTTP Streaming: Has problems. It relies on two assumptions:\nProxy will forward each chunk immediately → Not guaranteed Browser will immediately execute arrived JS chunks → Not guaranteed Reverse proxy problems # Reverse proxies appear as the actual server from the client\u0026rsquo;s perspective, but play the role of forwarding requests to the real server behind them.\nClient → [Reverse Proxy] → Actual Server (Nginx, Apache, etc.) Both long polling and streaming work, but there are performance issues. Most proxies aren\u0026rsquo;t designed to maintain many connections for long periods.\nConnection Sharing Problem # This is the most serious problem. Proxies like Apache mod_jk are designed to have multiple clients share a small number of connections.\n[Apache mod_jk connection pool: 8 connections] Client A\u0026#39;s long poll → Connection 1 occupied (30 seconds...) Client B\u0026#39;s long poll → Connection 2 occupied (30 seconds...) Client C\u0026#39;s long poll → Connection 3 occupied (30 seconds...) ... Client H\u0026#39;s long poll → Connection 8 occupied (30 seconds...) Client I\u0026#39;s regular request → No connection! Waiting... Client J\u0026#39;s regular request → No connection! Waiting... When all 8 connections are occupied by long polls, all other requests (whether long poll or regular) get blocked. This is called connection starvation.\nRoot cause: Synchronous vs Asynchronous # Model Operation Long Poll Impact Synchronous One thread/connection per request Severe resource exhaustion Asynchronous Event-based, minimal resources per connection Minimal impact Synchronous examples: Apache mod_jk, Java Servlet 2.5 Asynchronous examples: Nginx, Node.js, Java Servlet 3.0+\nConclusion: When using long polling/streaming, must avoid connection sharing. HTTP\u0026rsquo;s basic assumption is \u0026ldquo;each request completes as quickly as possible,\u0026rdquo; but long poll breaks this assumption.\n4. HTTP Responses # This is simple. Just follow standard HTTP.\nWhen server successfully receives a request, respond with 200 OK Response timing: event occurrence, state change, or timeout Response body includes actual event/state/timeout information Nothing special, just comply with HTTP specifications.\n5. Timeouts # Dilemma # Setting long poll timeout values is tricky:\nIf set too high:\nMay receive 408 Request Timeout from server May receive 504 Gateway Timeout from proxy Slow detection of disconnected network connections If set too low:\nUnnecessary requests/responses increase Network traffic waste Server load increase Experimental results and recommended values # Browser default timeout: 300 seconds (5 minutes) Values that succeeded in experiments: up to 120 seconds Safe recommended value: 30 seconds Most network infrastructure (proxies, load balancers, etc.) don\u0026rsquo;t have timeouts as long as browsers. Intermediate equipment can disconnect first.\nRecommendations for network equipment vendors # To be long polling compatible, timeouts must be set significantly longer than 30 seconds. \u0026ldquo;Significantly\u0026rdquo; here means several times the average network round-trip time or more.\n6. Impact on Intermediary Entities # Transparency problem # Long poll requests are indistinguishable from regular HTTP requests from the perspective of intermediate equipment (proxies, gateways, etc.). There\u0026rsquo;s no way to tell them \u0026ldquo;this is a long poll, so handle it specially.\u0026rdquo;\nThis can cause intermediate equipment to do unnecessary work:\nAttempt caching (shouldn\u0026rsquo;t cache real-time data) Apply timeouts (long poll is supposed to take long) Attempt connection reuse (long poll has long occupation time) Cache prevention # The most important thing is cache prevention. If real-time data is cached, clients receive past data.\nHeader that must be set:\nCache-Control: no-cache This header must be included in both requests and responses. It\u0026rsquo;s a standard HTTP header, so most intermediate equipment understands and respects it.\n7. Security Considerations # RFC 6202 is a document that describes existing usage patterns of HTTP, not proposing new features. Therefore, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t create new security vulnerabilities. However, there are security issues that exist in already deployed solutions.\n1. Injection attacks (Cross-Domain Long Polling) # Problem situation:\nWhen using the JSONP method in cross-domain long polling, the browser executes JavaScript returned by the server.\n// Server response (JSONP) callback({\u0026#34;price\u0026#34;: 52300}); If the server is vulnerable to injection attacks, attackers can insert malicious code:\n// Response manipulated by attacker callback({\u0026#34;price\u0026#34;: 52300}); stealCookies(); The browser executes this as is.\nCountermeasures:\nThorough server-side input validation Use CORS and avoid JSONP Set Content-Type headers accurately 2. DoS (Denial of Service) attacks # Problem situation:\nLong polling and HTTP streaming must maintain many connections for long periods. If attackers open a large number of long poll connections:\nAttacker → Opens 1,000 connections (each waiting 30 seconds) ↓ Server resource exhaustion → Normal users cannot receive service Regular HTTP requests end quickly, so resource occupation time per connection is short. But long poll is intentionally maintained for long periods, making it vulnerable to DoS.\nCountermeasures:\nLimit connections per IP Allow long poll only for authenticated users Apply rate limiting Use asynchronous servers (minimize resources per connection) Conclusion # By reading RFC 6202, I learned how server push events were created in the past. It was good to learn in more detail about the knowledge and problems of polling, streaming, and SSE mechanisms that I already knew.\nThe organized thought from reading this document is that it\u0026rsquo;s a concept of extending the HTTP protocol rather than a new protocol, and because HTTP by design is not a protocol for bidirectional asynchronous communication, it felt like they abused it to achieve the purpose of server event push.\nIn the next post, I\u0026rsquo;ll organize the RFC 6455 WebSocket document and try to connect the problems from RFC 6202 with the development process.\n","date":"2026-01-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/260112_before_websocket/","section":"Posts","summary":"Let\u0026rsquo;s explore HTTP long polling and HTTP streaming by reading RFC 6202 about bidirectional communication before WebSocket","title":"Bidirectional Communication Before WebSocket","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2026-01-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/categories/http-long-polling/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"HTTP Long Polling","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"2026-01-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/categories/http-streaming/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Http Streaming","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"2026-01-12","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/categories/rfc6202/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"RFC6202","type":"categories"},{"content":" Looking Back on 2025 # In July and November 2024, my ulcerative colitis worsened to the point where there were no more treatment options available, leading to two surgeries to remove my entire colon.

My Dream of Being a National Athlete Since I was young, I loved sports so much that I dreamed of becoming an athlete. My dream was to wear the Taegeuk mark on my chest and compete in the Olympics.\nI was active as a track and field athlete since elementary school, but my parents were strongly opposed to me becoming an athlete.\nPrevious Next Then, with my uncle (a rugby player) persuading and encouraging my parents, I was able to start playing rugby from middle school and dream of becoming a national athlete.\nAt that time, I was truly happy every day, thinking that I could do what I was good at and loved, and achieve my dream.\nHowever, before graduating from middle school, I got injured and while receiving examinations at the hospital, I learned that my platelet count was very low and was told I needed to go to a university hospital.\nAfter graduating from middle school, I enrolled in a regular high school and temporarily stopped my athletic career to focus on hospital examinations and treatment.\nI was told that if my levels returned to normal after a 6-month observation period, I could return as an athlete, but as time passed, I was eventually diagnosed with a rare disease called Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura.\nThe doctor diagnosed that it was too dangerous to continue life as an athlete, and so my first dream came to an end.\nThe sadness of losing my dream and the hospital life were so hard and difficult that I thought about dying. The memories of my first year of high school remain the most difficult period of my life to this day.\nJust as I was gradually adapting to hospital treatment, in the winter of my second year of high school, another rare disease called Ulcerative Colitis found me. This disease tormented me at every opportunity, making daily life difficult, and even until most recently, it pushed me to the edge of a cliff once again.\nEP2. A New Beginning and End as an Athletic Trainer I adapted to the pain and hospital life, spending time with friends to overcome the difficult times, and in my heart I promised myself:\n\u0026quot;There will be no more setbacks, and even if I fall, I will get up and move forward\u0026quot;\nAnd I had a new dream. Although I could no longer be an athlete, I dreamed of becoming an athletic trainer who supports athletes.\nAlthough I started studying later than others, I got up once again and did my best, and as time passed, I got into the university I wanted.\nPrevious Next After entering university, I studied while working as a trainer, and spent happy times feeling rewarded teaching athlete rehabilitation and weight training.\nAs graduation approached, the coronavirus pandemic hit.\nAfter receiving the COVID vaccine, my ulcerative colitis suddenly worsened, and although I received hospitalization treatment, it repeatedly worsened and improved, making it impossible for me to continue working as a trainer. While receiving treatment at this time, I had realistic concerns.\nCan I continue this profession as a trainer?\nDue to the nature of the job, I have to meet people in person, but if I occasionally get hospitalized, it causes problems for the athletes and clients I manage. Even though it\u0026rsquo;s not as much as when I was an athlete, I judged that constantly maintaining and building my body would be too much for my health condition.\nIn the end, after much thought, I decided to keep the word 'sports' no longer as a dream but as the happiest memory in my heart.\nEP3. The Goal of Becoming a Developer: Another New Challenge While wrapping up my trainer work, I thought about what I should do in the future. This rare disease will continue to torment me, so what kind of work should I do? Before embarking on a new challenge, I established two conditions:\nLet me do work I enjoy. Because then I can pour my passion into it. I must be able to work regardless of location. Because sometimes my illness might worsen and I may need hospitalization treatment. While pondering deeply, I looked back at the past to see what I might enjoy. Looking back at childhood memories, besides sports in elementary school, I also liked making and controlling robots in after-school programs, and funny enough, this child who dreamed of being an athlete actually dreamed of being a scientist until 3rd grade.\nAfter much thought, I had a new goal: developer. I really liked playing games, and I also had unfounded confidence that if it was work sitting in front of a computer, I could sit and work longer than anyone.\nAs always, moving forward on an uncharted path is difficult, but because the joy of learning new things accompanies it, I spent enjoyable time and began a new challenge as a developer.\nEP4. First Steps as a Developer Although it was a career very far from my university major, I started studying anyway. While studying alone, thinking that this would just be digging around aimlessly, I decided to start a bootcamp.\nSince I wasn\u0026rsquo;t a major, I devoted myself like crazy during the bootcamp to catch up to their knowledge. I studied the basics of web backend development and began to get a feel for it by working on projects.\nAfter the bootcamp ended, I looked for teams doing side projects, and luckily there were people with high experience in the project I started, receiving a lot of help and growing a lot during this time.\nAs time passed, I prepared as a web backend developer and started knocking on the door of employment, and I entered my first company.\nAt my first company, I also met good mentors and learned many things, and above all, I really liked that I could experience various fields while working as a developer.\nEP5. The Biggest Surgery of My Life While spending time working as a developer at my first company, around 1 year and 7 months later in July 2024, my ulcerative colitis suddenly worsened and I was hospitalized.\nSince I had been suffering from this disease for almost 10 years, I casually applied for remote work and started hospitalization treatment. Normally, I would receive medication treatment and be discharged after about 3 days, but this time the medication didn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nIt gradually worsened and I began to experience deadly pain, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t endure the pain without receiving a narcotic painkiller called morphine, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even sleep.\nI tried a new drug that had come out, but it was useless, and clinical trial drugs were refused due to thrombocytopenia. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t even drink water and went to the bathroom every 5 minutes, pouring out bloody stools.\nThe doctor said there were no more medications to treat me and the only way was to remove the entire colon. To make matters worse, surgeries were backed up so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have surgery right away, and I finally had surgery almost a month after being hospitalized.\nI had to have two surgeries total, and after the first surgery to remove my entire colon, I wore a bag on my stomach for 3 months and returned to work. After 3 months, I had a second surgery to remove the bag from my stomach and connect the small intestine to the anus.\nNow I\u0026rsquo;ve said goodbye to the ulcerative colitis that tormented me so much, but my recovery after surgery was delayed, and I eventually decided to resign and rest.\nEP6. Rest and Preparation for a Leap Forward While having major surgery, I experienced great frustration once again, but fortunately, ulcerative colitis will no longer torment me, so on the other hand, I felt relieved.\nPrevious Next After resigning, while recovering my body, I spent time studying things I hadn\u0026rsquo;t studied before, attending conferences, working on side projects I wanted to try, and preparing for a new leap forward.\nLife is unpredictable about what will happen next, but if I don't give up and move forward, when I look back from that end, I think the process I\u0026rsquo;ve gone through might become an interesting story.\n","date":"2025-11-22","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/life_log/","section":"0AndWild_log","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve had many difficult times, but I want to write about my life story of overcoming them, rising again, and running forward with all my effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eEP1.

Unified Comments Across Languages # const discussionId = \u0026#39;{{ .File.Dir | replaceRE \u0026#34;^content/\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026#34; | replaceRE \u0026#34;/$\u0026#34; \u0026#34;\u0026#34; }}\u0026#39;; Uses file directory path as Discussion ID content/posts/subscription_alert/index.ko.md → posts/subscription_alert content/posts/subscription_alert/index.en.md → posts/subscription_alert Same ID means Korean/English versions share the same comments Result:\nComments written on Korean post Also display on English post Separate Discussions created per post 4. Real-time Theme Change Detection # const observer = new MutationObserver((mutations) =\u0026gt; { mutations.forEach((mutation) =\u0026gt; { if (mutation.attributeName === \u0026#39;class\u0026#39;) { setTimeout(updateGiscusTheme, 100); } }); }); MutationObserver detects HTML class changes Immediately detects dark mode toggle clicks Sends theme change command to Giscus iframe via postMessage Testing Method # # 1.

GitHub Pages # I decided to migrate my tech blog from Tstory to Hugo \u0026amp; GitHub Pages.\n1. Scattered Content Management # As I used various note-taking tools, the content I wrote at work or while studying became scattered everywhere. Having to transfer these notes to the blog repeatedly became burdensome, which led me to neglect blog management.\n2. Markdown Compatibility Issues # The markdown syntax used in my note-taking tools wasn\u0026rsquo;t fully compatible with Tstory, requiring frequent modifications when publishing posts. This was also a source of frustration.\nSpecific issues included:\nInsufficient syntax highlighting support for code blocks Table rendering errors Image path handling problems Limited mathematical expression support 3. Tstory Open API Support Ended # Recently, I wanted to reorganize my study materials and post them on Tstory while redesigning the blog skin. I also planned to integrate existing note-taking tools using the Tstory Official Open API. However, I discovered that Open API support had been discontinued, and there was no longer a reason to continue using Tstory.\nBlog Platform Selection Criteria # After researching various blogs and considering what approach would work best, I settled on Hugo \u0026amp; GitHub Pages based on the following criteria:\nIs it easy to set up the blog? Can it be managed with code? Is there high flexibility to add features I want? Is the build and deployment speed fast when using GitHub Pages? Is it easy to integrate with note-taking tools like Obsidian? What is Hugo? # Hugo is a fast and flexible Static Site Generator written in the Go language.\nKey Features:\nFast build speed: Thousands of pages can be built in seconds Simple structure: Write content in Markdown and Hugo converts it to HTML Zero dependencies: Runs as a single binary without requiring separate runtime or database Rich theme ecosystem: Easy to apply themes for various purposes Comparing Static Site Generators Used with GitHub Pages # Feature Hugo Jekyll Gatsby Next.js (SSG) VuePress Language Go Ruby React (JavaScript) React (JavaScript) Vue.js Build Speed ⚡ Very Fast (\u0026lt; 1ms/page) 🐢 Slow 🚶 Moderate 🚶 Moderate 🚶 Moderate Installation Complexity ✅ Single Binary ⚠️ Ruby environment required ⚠️ Node.js + many dependencies ⚠️ Node.js + dependencies ⚠️ Node.js + dependencies GitHub Pages Native Support ❌ (Actions required) ✅ Native support ❌ (Actions required) ❌ (Actions required) ❌ (Actions required) Learning Curve Low Low High Medium-High Medium Themes/Plugins Rich Very Rich Rich (React ecosystem) Rich (React ecosystem) Moderate Best For Blog, Docs, Portfolio Blog, GitHub default Complex web apps, Blog Complex web apps, Hybrid Technical docs Build Time (1000 pages) ~1s ~2min ~30s ~30s ~20s Why I Chose Hugo:\nOverwhelming build speed: Build time barely increases even with more content Simple setup: Focus on Markdown without complex JavaScript frameworks Zero dependencies: No environment setup issues with a single executable Rich themes: Easy to apply high-quality themes like Blowfish GitHub Pages Deployment # Blogs written with Hugo are automatically built and deployed through GitHub Actions.\nDeployment Workflow # Push changes to the main branch GitHub Actions automatically triggers Hugo builds the static site Built files are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages Benefits # Automated deployment: Automatically deploys when you push code Version control: Track all changes through Git Free hosting: GitHub Pages is provided for free Custom domain: Can connect your desired domain HTTPS support: HTTPS is provided by default Obsidian Integration # Hugo is markdown-based, making it perfectly compatible with note-taking tools like Obsidian.\nIntegration Method # Set Hugo blog\u0026rsquo;s content/posts directory as Obsidian vault Write and edit posts in Obsidian When finished writing, commit \u0026amp; push through Git GitHub Actions automatically builds and deploys Benefits # Consistent writing environment: Manage all notes and blog posts in the same tool Perfect markdown compatibility: No additional conversion work needed Local-first: Can write posts without internet connection Powerful linking features: Utilize Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s backlinks and graph view Terminal Commands # Running Development Server # hugo server Starts a local development server. By default, you can view the site at http://localhost:1313.\nKey Options:\n-D or --buildDrafts: Builds draft content as well --bind 0.0.0.0: Makes server accessible from all network interfaces --port 8080: Uses a different port instead of the default (1313) Browser automatically refreshes when files change (Live Reload) Examples:\nhugo server -D hugo server --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 Production Build # hugo --cleanDestinationDir Builds the static site for production. Output is generated in the public/ directory.\nKey Features:\n--cleanDestinationDir: Completely cleans the destination directory (public/) before building Removes unnecessary files from previous builds for a clean build Ensures no old versions of files remain even when filenames are changed or deleted Examples:\nhugo --cleanDestinationDir hugo --cleanDestinationDir --minify # Add file minification option Theme Information # Hugo Blowfish Theme # This blog uses the Blowfish theme.\nFeatures:\nProvides modern and responsive design Supports dark mode Fast loading speed and SEO optimized Multilingual support Rich customization options Configuration Files:\nconfig/_default/hugo.toml - Basic Hugo configuration config/_default/params.toml - Blowfish theme parameters config/_default/languages.en.toml - Language-specific settings config/_default/menus.en.toml - Menu configuration Conclusion # The migration from Tstory to Hugo \u0026amp; GitHub Pages was a choice for a developer-friendly environment. Now I can manage my blog the same way I manage code versions, and with perfect Obsidian integration, I\u0026rsquo;ve unified the workflow from note-taking to blog posting.\nAbove all, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s fast build speed and GitHub Actions\u0026rsquo; automated deployment allow me to focus solely on writing, and I can freely customize without being bound by platform constraints.\nGoing forward, I plan to gradually migrate existing posts from Tstory while steadily adding new content.\nReferences # Hugo Official Site: https://gohugo.io/ Blowfish Theme: https://blowfish.page/ Blowfish Creator: @nunocoracao Creator Blog: https://n9o.xyz/ Official Docs: https://blowfish.page/docs/ License: MIT License ","date":"2025-10-15","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/251015_about_hugo/","section":"Posts","summary":"Moving to Hugo for better markdown compatibility, Open API support ended, and improved developer experience","title":"Why I Switched to Hugo \u0026 GitHub Pages","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2024-02-07","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/categories/backend/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Backend","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"2024-02-07","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/elasticsearch/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Elasticsearch","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-02-07","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/series/elasticsearch/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"ElasticSearch","type":"series"},{"content":" 1) Kind of Highlighter # ES supports highlighting for search results and provides 3 methods.\nEach type below can be applied separately to each field to be highlighted\nUnified (Default Highlighter) # The unified highlighter uses the Lucene unified highlighter. This highlighter breaks text into sentences and scores individual sentences as if they were documents in a corpus using the BM25 algorithm. It also supports accurate phrase and multi-term (fuzzy, prefix, regex) highlighting.\nFeatures\nBM25 algorithm-based sentence scoring Accurate phrase highlighting support Multi-term query support (fuzzy, prefix, regex) Plain # The plain highlighter is best suited for highlighting simple query matches in a single field.\nTo accurately reflect the query logic, it creates a small in-memory index and re-executes the original query criteria through Lucene\u0026rsquo;s query execution planner to access low-level match information for the current document.\nThis operation is repeated for every field and every document that needs to be highlighted. For highlighting many fields in many documents with complex queries, it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to use the unified highlighter with postings or term_vector fields.\nFeatures\nSuitable for simple queries on single fields Creates in-memory index Repeatedly executes for all fields and documents FVH (Fast Vector Highlighter) # The fvh highlighter uses the Lucene fast vector highlighter. This highlighter can be used on fields where term_vector is set to with_positions_offsets in the mapping.\nFeatures\nCustomizable with boundary_scanner Requires term_vector to be set to with_positions_offsets, which increases index size Can combine matches from multiple fields into one result (see matched_fields) Can assign different weights to matches at different positions, such as phrase matches being ranked higher than term matches when highlighting boosting queries that boost phrase matches over term matches Note: The fvh highlighter does not support span queries. If you need support for span queries, use another highlighter such as the unified highlighter.\n2) Offsets Strategy # To create meaningful search snippets from the terms being searched, the highlighter needs to know the start and end character offsets of each word in the original text. These offsets can be obtained from:\nPostings List # If index_options is set to offsets in the mapping, the unified highlighter uses this information to highlight documents without re-analyzing the text.\nThe original query is re-executed directly against the postings and matching offsets are extracted from the index to limit the collection to highlighted documents.\nThis is useful when you have large fields because there\u0026rsquo;s no need to re-analyze the text to be highlighted. It also requires less disk space than using term_vectors.\nAdvantages\nNo need to re-analyze text Useful for large fields Saves disk space compared to term_vectors Term Vectors # If term_vector is set to with_positions_offsets in the mapping to provide term vector information, the unified highlighter automatically uses term vectors to highlight fields.\nBecause you have access to each document\u0026rsquo;s term dictionary, it\u0026rsquo;s fast especially when highlighting multi-term queries like prefixes or wildcards on large fields (over 1MB).\nThe fvh highlighter always uses term vectors.\nAdvantages\nFast performance on large fields (over 1MB) Efficient for multi-term queries (prefixes, wildcards) Direct access to document\u0026rsquo;s term dictionary Plain Highlighting # This mode is used by unified when there are no other alternatives.\nIt creates a small in-memory index and re-executes the original query criteria through Lucene\u0026rsquo;s query execution planner to access low-level match information for the current document.\nThis operation is repeated for every field and every document that needs highlighting.\nThe plain highlighter always uses plain highlighting.\nFeatures\nUsed when there are no other options Creates in-memory index Repeatedly executes for all fields/documents References # Highlighting | Elasticsearch Guide [8.13]\n","date":"2024-02-07","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/240207_es/","section":"Posts","summary":"Three Elasticsearch highlighter methods including Unified, Plain, and FVH, along with efficient offset strategies using Postings List and Term Vectors","title":"Elasticsearch Highlighting Techniques","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2024-02-07","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/highlighting/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Highlighting","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-02-07","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/performance/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Performance","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-02-07","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/search/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Search","type":"tags"},{"content":" ElasticSearch Pagination: 3 Options # 1.

This is also the case when the last term (not a prefix) must match exactly. However, this may be less efficient than using the match_bool_prefix query.\nshingle token filter defaults to 2\nAppropriate Use Cases\nWhen the order of terms is important When the starting point and position of tokens are important If no analyzer is configured during indexing, the standard analyzer is applied by default.\nSuggester API # In-memory (Completion Suggester, Context Suggester) # Completion suggester provides auto-complete and search-as-you-type functionality.

Edit distance is a metric that measures how similar one string is to another string.\nEdit distance is typically measured through operations of adding, deleting, and substituting each word.\nFor example, to change the string \u0026ldquo;tamming test\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;taming text\u0026rdquo;, you need 1 operation to delete m and 1 operation to change s to x. Therefore, the edit distance is 2.\nIf there is no term matching the indexed data, term suggest will recommend similar words.\nIn the results, text represents the suggested character, and score indicates how close the suggested text is to the original.\nAlgorithms\nElasticsearch uses Levenshtein edit distance measurement or Jaro-Winkler edit distance measurement as edit distance calculation algorithms. Korean Processing\nFor Korean, data is not recommended even when using term suggest. This is fundamentally because the Korean Unicode system is complex. Korean typo handling is possible through ICU analyzer. ICU analyzer is specifically developed for internationalization and has built-in functions to decompose and combine Korean graphemes. However, for sophisticated features such as typo correction, Korean-English conversion, and autocomplete, it is recommended to develop separate plugins.

Therefore, even if types are different, fields with the same name are not independent, which can cause various problems. As a result, it was modified so that one index can only have one type.\nComparison with RDB # In the case of RDB\nA single DB can have multiple tables, and columns with the same name in each table do not affect each other. In the case of Elasticsearch\nIf there are fields (=columns) with the same name in each type (=table) within one index (=DB), those fields are not independent and are stored in the same Lucene field, requiring the same definition.

It functions not only as a web server but also as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache.\nNginx was designed to handle high concurrent connections and is currently used by numerous large-scale websites worldwide.\nWhy Was Nginx Needed? # In the past, Apache web server was the industry standard. However, in the early 2000s, as internet users grew exponentially, a bottleneck called the C10k problem emerged.\nThe C10k Problem # The C10k problem stands for \u0026ldquo;Connection 10,000,\u0026rdquo; meaning handling 10,000 concurrent client connections on a single server.\nImportant Concept Distinction\nConcurrent Processing: Maintaining and managing many connections simultaneously Throughput: Number of requests that can be processed per second Concurrent connection handling focuses on efficient resource management and scheduling rather than raw speed.\nApache\u0026rsquo;s Architectural Limitations # Traditional Apache had the following structural issues:\n1. Process-Based Processing # Creates a new process or thread for each incoming request Number of processes increases proportionally with users Results in memory exhaustion 2. High Resource Consumption # Apache\u0026rsquo;s powerful extensibility allows various module additions However, each process loads all modules into memory Memory usage per process increases 3. Context-Switching Overhead # CPU cores alternate between multiple processes Context-switching costs occur during process transitions CPU overhead increases with more requests Due to these issues, Apache was unsuitable for large-scale concurrent connection environments.\nThe Birth of Nginx # In 2002, Russian developer Igor Sysoev began developing Nginx to solve this problem, releasing the first version in 2004.\nNginx\u0026rsquo;s Core Goals # High concurrent connection handling Low memory footprint High performance and stability Nginx\u0026rsquo;s Primary Roles # HTTP Server: Quickly serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS, images) Reverse Proxy Server: Relays requests to backend application servers Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple servers Mail Proxy Server: Mail server proxy functionality Nginx Internal Architecture # Nginx consists of 1 Master Process and multiple Worker Processes.\nMaster Process Responsibilities # The Master Process handles:\nReading and validating configuration files Creating and managing Worker Processes Restarting Worker Processes on configuration changes # Check Master Process ps aux | grep nginx Worker Process Responsibilities # Worker Processes handle actual client requests:\n1. Connection Management # Receives listen socket from Master Process Forms connections with clients Maintains connections for Keep-Alive duration One Worker handles thousands of connections simultaneously 2. Non-blocking I/O # Processes other tasks when no requests on connection Responds immediately when requests arrive Efficient processing via asynchronous Event-Driven approach 3. Thread Pool # Delegates time-consuming tasks (file I/O, DB queries) to Thread Pool Worker Process continues handling other requests Minimizes impact of blocking operations 4. CPU Core Optimization # Worker Processes are typically created equal to CPU core count Each Worker pinned to specific CPU core (CPU Affinity) Minimizes Context-Switching for performance improvement # nginx.conf configuration example worker_processes auto; # Auto-create based on CPU core count worker_cpu_affinity auto; # Auto-set CPU affinity Event-Driven Architecture # Nginx operates with Multi-process + Single-thread + Event-Driven approach:\nEvent Handler manages multiple connections Processes via asynchronous Non-blocking method Executes ready events sequentially Maximizes resource efficiency without idle processes This allows efficient memory and CPU usage without processes waiting idle for requests like Apache.\nNginx Advantages and Disadvantages # Advantages # 1. High Concurrent Connection Capability # 10x more concurrent connections compared to Apache 2x faster processing speed for same connection count 2. Low Resource Usage # Operates with fewer processes Minimized memory usage Fast response times with lightweight structure 3. Zero-Downtime Configuration Reload # nginx -s reload # Apply configuration without service interruption Master Process reads new configuration Existing Workers finish current requests then terminate New Workers handle requests with new configuration Configuration changes without service interruption 4. Superior Static File Handling # Quickly serves static content like images, CSS, JS Better static file performance than Apache Disadvantages # 1. Difficult Dynamic Module Development # Worker Process restart needed when adding modules Harder module development compared to Apache Partially compensated by Lua scripting 2. Windows Environment Limitations # Optimized for Linux/Unix environments Performance and stability degraded on Windows Linux recommended for production environments 3. No .htaccess Support # Cannot use Apache\u0026rsquo;s .htaccess files All configuration managed in central config file May lack flexibility in hosting environments Key Nginx Features # 1. Reverse Proxy # A reverse proxy acts as an intermediary between clients and backend servers.\nKey Benefits # Enhanced Security: Hides actual server IP Caching: Caches frequently requested responses Compression: Saves bandwidth by compressing response data SSL Processing: Handles HTTPS encryption/decryption # Reverse proxy configuration example location / { proxy_pass http://backend_server; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } Practical Usage Patterns # Nginx + Apache: Nginx handles static files, Apache handles dynamic processing Nginx + Node.js/Python/Java: Nginx protects frontend and backend applications Nginx + Nginx: Hierarchical configuration of multiple Nginx servers 2. Load Balancing # Distributes traffic across multiple backend servers to balance load evenly.\nLoad Balancing Algorithms # Round Robin (Default) # Distributes requests sequentially to each server Simplest and most fair approach upstream backend { server backend1.example.com; server backend2.example.com; server backend3.example.com; } Least Connections # Sends to server with fewest current connections Suitable for requests with varying processing times upstream backend { least_conn; server backend1.example.com; server backend2.example.com; } IP Hash # Determines server based on client IP hash Useful for Session Persistence upstream backend { ip_hash; server backend1.example.com; server backend2.example.com; } Weight # Assigns weight based on server performance Sends more requests to high-performance servers upstream backend { server backend1.example.com weight=3; server backend2.example.com weight=2; server backend3.example.com weight=1; } Health Check # upstream backend { server backend1.example.com max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s; server backend2.example.com max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s; } max_fails: Number of allowed failures fail_timeout: Time to consider server down Improves availability by automatically excluding failed servers 3. SSL/TLS Termination # Nginx handles HTTPS communication with clients and HTTP communication with backend.\nKey Benefits # Removes SSL processing burden from backend servers Centralized certificate management Backend focuses on business logic Nginx and backend communicate via HTTP on same internal network (security safe) server { listen 443 ssl http2; server_name example.com; ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem; ssl_certificate_key /path/to/key.pem; ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } } HTTP/2 Support # Nginx supports HTTP/2:\nMultiplexing: Multiple requests simultaneously over one connection Header Compression: Saves bandwidth Server Push: Sends resources before client requests 4. Caching # Stores server responses in memory or disk for fast responses on repeated requests.\n# Cache path configuration proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx levels=1:2 keys_zone=my_cache:10m max_size=1g; server { location / { proxy_cache my_cache; proxy_cache_valid 200 60m; # Cache 200 responses for 60 minutes proxy_cache_valid 404 10m; # Cache 404 responses for 10 minutes proxy_pass http://backend; } } Caching Strategies # Proxy Caching: Cache backend responses FastCGI Caching: Cache dynamic content like PHP-FPM Static File Caching: Set browser cache headers # Static file cache header configuration location ~* \\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|css|js)$ { expires 1y; add_header Cache-Control \u0026#34;public, immutable\u0026#34;; } 5. Compression (Gzip) # Compress response data to save network bandwidth\ngzip on; gzip_vary on; gzip_min_length 1024; gzip_types text/plain text/css text/xml text/javascript application/x-javascript application/xml+rss application/json application/javascript; Compress text-based content by 60-80% Improves user experience by reducing transfer time 6. Rate Limiting # Defend against DDoS attacks and protect servers\n# Define zone limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=10r/s; server { location /api/ { limit_req zone=mylimit burst=20 nodelay; proxy_pass http://backend; } } Limit requests per second per IP burst: Allow sudden traffic spikes Essential for API server protection Nginx vs Apache: Which Should You Choose? # Choose Nginx When # High concurrent connection handling is needed Static file service is primary purpose Reverse proxy/load balancer is needed Resource efficiency is important Modern protocol support needed (HTTP/2, HTTP/3) Choose Apache When # .htaccess file-based configuration is needed Various third-party modules are needed Must use in Windows environment Legacy application compatibility is important Frequent dynamic module development Optimal Combination: Nginx + Apache # Many companies use Nginx as frontend and Apache as backend:\n[Client] → [Nginx] → [Apache] → [Application] Static Dynamic SSL PHP/Python Caching Modules Production Tips # 1. Worker Connections Configuration # events { worker_connections 1024; # Connections per Worker use epoll; # Optimal event model for Linux } 2. Keepalive Optimization # http { keepalive_timeout 65; keepalive_requests 100; } 3. Buffer Size Tuning # http { client_body_buffer_size 16K; client_header_buffer_size 1k; client_max_body_size 8m; large_client_header_buffers 4 8k; } 4. Log Optimization # http { access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log combined buffer=32k; error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log warn; } 5. Security Hardening # # Hide version information server_tokens off; # Add security headers add_header X-Frame-Options \u0026#34;SAMEORIGIN\u0026#34; always; add_header X-Content-Type-Options \u0026#34;nosniff\u0026#34; always; add_header X-XSS-Protection \u0026#34;1; mode=block\u0026#34; always; Conclusion # Nginx has established itself as a core component of modern web infrastructure. With high performance and efficiency through Event-Driven architecture, it\u0026rsquo;s used by large-scale services like Netflix, Airbnb, and GitHub.\nWhile Apache\u0026rsquo;s stability and extensibility remain valuable, in modern web environments where large-scale traffic handling and resource efficiency are crucial, Nginx is the more suitable choice.\nRecommended Learning Path\nInstall Nginx in local environment and practice basic configuration Set up reverse proxy Configure and test load balancing Apply SSL certificates (Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt) Performance monitoring and optimization References # Nginx Official Documentation Nginx Configuration Generator Nginx Performance Tuning Guide Important Note: Nginx shows limited performance and compatibility on Windows environments, so it\u0026rsquo;s strongly recommended to use Linux/Unix systems in production!\n","date":"2022-10-25","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/221025_about_nginx/","section":"Posts","summary":"A comprehensive guide covering high-performance web server Nginx concepts, Apache comparison, Event-Driven architecture, and practical features used in production","title":"What is Nginx?

Host Virtualization # Structure: Guest OS runs on top of Host OS through virtualization software.\nExamples: VM Workstation, VMware Player, VirtualBox, etc. Advantages:\nSimple installation and configuration Minimal host requirements through hardware emulation Disadvantages:\nResource-intensive due to running OS on top of OS Significant performance overhead 2. Hypervisor Virtualization # Structure: Software is installed and runs directly on hardware without a Host OS.\nTwo Approaches to Hypervisor Virtualization:\n1) Full Virtualization # Guest OS accesses hardware through the hypervisor, not directly More stable but has performance overhead 2) Paravirtualization # Guest OS directly accesses hardware through the hypervisor Faster but requires OS modifications Advantages:\nMore efficient without Host OS Better resource utilization Disadvantages:\nSlow startup time Still consumes significant resources as each VM runs an independent OS 3. Container Virtualization ⭐ # Structure: Applications share the host OS kernel while maintaining isolated environments.\nAdvantages:\nLightweight: Typically tens of MB (VMs are tens of GB) Fast startup: No need to boot a separate OS Low resource usage: Efficient utilization of system resources High density: Run more containers on the same hardware Disadvantages:\nRequires the same OS environment as the host system Cross-platform deployment can be challenging (e.g., Linux containers require Linux host) 📊 Virtualization Comparison # Category Host Virtualization Hypervisor Virtualization Container Virtualization Size Tens of GB Tens of GB Tens of MB Startup Speed Slow Slow Very Fast Resource Usage High Medium Low Isolation Level High High Medium Portability Low Medium High Setup Difficulty Easy Hard Medium 💡 Summary # Core Value of Docker Container Virtualization:\nEfficiency: Provides the same functionality with far fewer resources than traditional virtualization Speed: Start and stop applications in seconds Consistency: Runs identically across development, testing, and production environments Scalability: Easy to add or remove containers as needed Docker is a core tool for modern application development and deployment, serving as the foundation for DevOps and microservices architecture.\n","date":"2022-10-24","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/221024_about_docker/","section":"Posts","summary":"Docker is an open-source platform that packages applications into containers, enabling them to run reliably across different environments.

The relationship between private and public IPs You might be confused when you first see the diagram above, but after reading the entire article, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to understand it with an \u0026ldquo;Aha!\u0026rdquo; moment. 📅 2011, IPv4 Address Exhaustion Declared # The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which manages internet addresses, declared that there would be no more IPv4 allocations. While IPv4 can use approximately 4.3 billion limited addresses, the rapid increase in internet demand exhausted the IPv4 addresses allocated to each continent.\nIANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) is an organization that manages IP addresses, top-level domains, etc. It is currently managed by ICANN. But How Are We Still Using IPv4? # So here we are in 2022, 11 years after IPv4 ran out, and we\u0026rsquo;re still using IPv4 just fine. How is this possible?\nIPv6 was developed long ago and is gradually being commercialized. Nevertheless, IPv4 usage is still much more prevalent, so how has it been maintained well until now, 11 years later?\nThis is thanks to Private Networks. 🔌 What is a Private Network? # A private network refers to a network that uses a specific range of IPv4 addresses within limited spaces such as homes and businesses, rather than on the public internet. Private IP ranges that belong to private networks can only be used within the private network (internal network), so they cannot be used on the public network (external network, internet).\nPrivate IP ranges What is a Public IP? # A public IP is necessary for different PCs to communicate with each other over the internet and is used for purposes such as:\nBuilding website servers PC internet connection Communication via the internet Each country has an organization that manages public IPs. In Korea, the Korea Internet \u0026amp; Security Agency (KISA) manages them. Public IP address system 💡 Concept Summary # Private networks can only be used within limited spaces such as homes or businesses. So how do we communicate with other PCs that don\u0026rsquo;t use the same private network as us?\nWe need a public IP!\nIn other words, special measures are needed to communicate with the public internet from a private network. Private IPs are regulated to be used only within private networks, so private IPs cannot be used on the public internet.\n🔄 NAT (Network Address Translation) # To address this, Network Address Translation (NAT) was devised as a method to convert IP addresses.\nWhat is NAT?\nIt refers to a technology that sends and receives network traffic through a router while rewriting TCP/UDP port numbers and source and destination IP addresses of IP packets. Since changes occur in packets, IP and TCP/UDP checksums must also be recalculated and rewritten.\nThe reason for using NAT is usually to allow multiple hosts belonging to a private network to access the internet using a single public IP address.\nIn other words, it means converting to the IP used in the public/private network when communicating from a private network to a public network and vice versa. According to the above explanation, converting TCP/UDP port numbers of IP packets is actually because NAT includes not only IP addresses but also port conversion!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s called PAT or NAPT (Port Address Translation).\n📡 Router Functions # These days, most homes have routers installed and in use (e.g., iptime, olleh, etc.).\nThese routers have various functions.\n1. DHCP Server Function # First, there\u0026rsquo;s a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server function that assigns IPs to various devices connected through a single router.\nDynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)\nDHCP is an IP standard that simplifies host IP configuration management. It provides a method to dynamically assign IP addresses and other related configuration details to DHCP-enabled clients on the network using a DHCP server.\nThrough this, smart devices and PCs inside the house connected to the router are each assigned a private IP.\nWhy are they assigned private IPs?\nIf you go back to the very first explanation, you\u0026rsquo;ll understand\u0026hellip;?!\nSince the number of IP allocations is limited, we can\u0026rsquo;t assign a public IP to every home, or rather, every device, so we assign private IPs to build a private network! By building a private network this way, communication is possible internally, but we still can\u0026rsquo;t communicate with the external internet.\n2. NAT Function # That\u0026rsquo;s why routers have a NAT function.\nFunction to convert private IPs to public IPs Build their own mapping table and manage pre-conversion and post-conversion values with a NAT table Of course, the router doesn\u0026rsquo;t have its own public IP! The router uses the public IP range provided by internet service providers (KT, SKT, LG, etc.)! What is a VPN (Virtual Private Network)? # Going further, let\u0026rsquo;s learn about VPNs, which we may have used but don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what role they play!\nVPN stands for Virtual Private Network, which, as the name suggests, is a private network but a virtual one. The VPN I knew was something that changes IPs or fakes IPs for illegal purposes\u0026hellip; 🤔\nI thought it was something like that, but it\u0026rsquo;s half right and half wrong!\nThe True Meaning of VPN # VPN refers to being able to use an external computer as if it were connected to an internal network (private network).\nThe reason why the IP changes when using VPN can also be understood if you think carefully about private/public networks mentioned above.\nThe IP changes because you\u0026rsquo;ve connected to the internal network (private network) through VPN! 💼 VPN Use Cases # 1. Remote Work/Telecommuting # Through this, companies with private networks set up VPN servers, and through external public IP addresses and configured IDs/passwords, you can access the company\u0026rsquo;s private network from anywhere.\n2. Remote Computer Access # Similarly, for personal computers, through VPN setup, if you know the external public IP address, you can access your computer in Seoul from Jeju Island through VPN from anywhere.\n3. Bypassing Geographical Restrictions # When a website in a certain country blocks access from our country\u0026rsquo;s IP, we cannot access that site. To access this site, we need to approach with an IP address from a country other than ours. At this time, through VPN, we can bypass the blocked firewall as if we\u0026rsquo;re accessing from an internal network in another country.\n4. Firewall Bypass Mechanism # Hypothetical Scenario\nIf a company blocks access to SNS during work hours as an internal policy, we connect through VPN set up at home or an overseas VPN. Then we can access SNS.\nWhy does this work?\nThe moment you connect to VPN, a virtual tunnel is formed, and packets sent for communication between tunnels are broken down into smaller pieces and undergo encryption and encapsulation. At this time, although it passes through the company\u0026rsquo;s firewall, because it\u0026rsquo;s an encrypted/encapsulated packet, the firewall cannot detect that you\u0026rsquo;re trying to access SNS through VPN, so it lets the packet pass through.\nVPN tunneling structure 📋 VPN Summary # 👍 Advantages # Data security 🔒 Online privacy protection 📍 IP address change 🛡️ Personal protection 🚀 Bandwidth throttling prevention 👎 Disadvantages # While VPN has many advantages as mentioned above, it also has disadvantages.\n🐢 Devices connected to VPN must communicate with the VPN server using encryption, so network speed is very slow ⚠️ Some VPNs with low reliability exist 💰 You must pay to use VPNs with high security 🚫 Not available in some countries ","date":"2022-10-05","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/221005_about_ip/","section":"Posts","summary":"Learn the differences between private and public IPs, the role of NAT (Network Address Translation), and how VPNs work.

The Dispatcher Servlet can be defined as a Front Controller that receives all incoming HTTP protocol requests first and delegates them to the appropriate controller.\nOperation Overview # The more detailed process is as follows:\nWhen a request comes from the client, a servlet container such as Tomcat receives the request All these requests are received first by the Dispatcher Servlet, which is the Front Controller The Dispatcher Servlet processes common tasks first and then finds the controller that should handle the request and delegates the work Front Controller Pattern # The term Front Controller refers to a controller that receives and processes all client requests coming to the server at the front of the servlet container, and it is a design pattern used together with the MVC architecture.\nHow Dispatcher Servlet Works # The Dispatcher Servlet is the Front-Controller that receives requests first.\nIt passes through filters in the Servlet Context (Web Context) The Dispatcher Servlet receives the request first in the Spring Context The Dispatcher Servlet must find the appropriate controller and method to delegate the request, and the operation process is as follows.\nDetailed Operation Process # 1. HTTP Request passes through Filter and is received by Dispatcher Servlet # 2. Check request information and find the Controller to delegate # RequestMappingHandlerMapping, one of the implementations of HandlerMapping, parses all controller beans written with @Controller and manages (request information, processing target) as a HashMap.\nIt finds the HandlerMethod object that contains the controller and method mapped to the request. Therefore, when a request comes in, HandlerMapping creates a Key object (request information) using HTTP Method, URI, etc., finds the HandlerMethod to process the request as Value, wraps it in HandlerMethodExecutionChain, and returns it.\nThe reason for this wrapping is to include interceptors that need to be processed before passing the request to the controller.\n3. Find and pass the HandlerAdapter to delegate to the Controller # The Dispatcher Servlet does not delegate requests directly to the controller, but delegates them through HandlerAdapter.\nThe reason for going through the HandlerAdapter interface is that there are various ways to implement controllers. While controller classes are mainly written using @Controller with @RequestMapping related annotations, controller classes can also be written by implementing the Controller interface.\nTherefore, Spring applies the adapter pattern through the HandlerAdapter interface, allowing requests to be delegated to Controllers regardless of the controller implementation method.\n4. HandlerAdapter delegates the request to the Controller # Common pre/post processing is required before HandlerAdapter passes the request to the Controller.\nTypically:\nInterceptor processing ArgumentResolver to handle @RequestParam, @RequestBody, etc. in requests ReturnValueHandler that handles processing such as serializing the Body of ResponseEntity to JSON in responses These processes are handled before being passed from the adapter to the controller. Then it delegates the request to invoke the controller\u0026rsquo;s method.\n5. Process Business Logic # The Controller calls the service and proceeds with business logic.\n6. Controller returns the return value # Returns ResponseEntity or View name.\n7. HandlerAdapter processes the return value # HandlerAdapter returns the response received from the controller to the Dispatcher Servlet after post-processing by the ReturnValueHandler, the response processor.\nIf the controller returns ResponseEntity → HttpEntityMethodProcessor uses MessageConverter to serialize the response object and set the response status (HttpStatus) If View name is returned → View is returned through ViewResolver 8.

At this point, the JVM plays the role of interpreting this bytecode so the OS can understand it.\nThanks to this role of the JVM, Java code written once can be executed regardless of the OS.\nOverall Process # *.java → converted to bytecode form *.class → converted to machine code (binary code) through JIT (Just In Time) compiler\nWhat is JIT (Just In Time) Compiler? # Also called JIT compilation or dynamic translation.\nJIT was introduced to complement the shortcomings of the interpreter approach.\nIt translates to machine code at the actual execution time of the program.\nPerformance Characteristics # Since machine code is stored in cache, code that has been compiled once executes quickly. The process of JIT compiler compiling to machine code is much slower than interpreting bytecode, but once executed, it\u0026rsquo;s fast afterwards However, for code that runs only once, it\u0026rsquo;s advantageous to interpret directly without compiling JVM using JIT compiler checks how often a method is executed and only compiles when it exceeds a certain threshold.\nWhat is the Interpreter Approach? # An interpreter translates source code line by line to machine code at each execution, so execution speed is slower than statically compiled languages.\nRepresentative Interpreter Languages # Python JavaScript Database language SQL Advantages and Disadvantages # Category Description Advantages Simple program modification Disadvantages Execution speed is slower than compiled languages Compilers translate source code to create executable files, so when program modifications occur, the source code must be recompiled.\nIf the program is small and simple, there\u0026rsquo;s no problem, but as the program grows larger, compilation often takes hours.\nHowever, with an interpreter, you just modify the source code and run it, so it\u0026rsquo;s widely used in programming where modifications occur frequently.\n","date":"2022-09-22","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/220922_jvm_1/","section":"Posts","summary":"A deep dive into the core concepts and operating principles of the Java Virtual Machine.

Can it restrict data access? Generally, languages that satisfy these criteria are considered to have stronger object-oriented characteristics.\nProcedural Programming # Procedural programming literally means structuring code procedurally.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s an approach where you identify the sequence of data operations and create functions for necessary features, executing them procedurally (in order).\nObject-Oriented Programming # Object-oriented programming bundles functionalities into objects.\nIn other words, you create individual objects, each bundling the behaviors (functions) and data they can handle.\nExample # Imagine implementing a ride-hailing service:\nCar Object: Bundles all the behaviors (functions) a car can perform Driver Object: Bundles all the behaviors a driver can perform Passenger Object: Bundles all the behaviors a passenger can perform The algorithm is constructed through interactions between these objects by calling their methods and fields.\nSo Which Approach is Better? # There\u0026rsquo;s no definitive answer. Use what fits your needs and your preferred style. Programming in the Past # In the past, we didn\u0026rsquo;t need hardware and software on the scale we do today. Old languages like C, Fortran, and COBOL - representative procedural languages - were widely used.\nModern Programming # As we entered the modern era, software development accelerated and code became increasingly complex.\nThis led to tangled algorithms, and code became difficult or impossible for humans to understand - resulting in spaghetti code.\nObject-oriented programming emerged as an alternative to address these issues.\nWhy is Object-Oriented Programming Dominant? # Currently, object-oriented programming is predominantly used. The reasons are:\nFor complex programs, using procedural programming makes code more prone to tangling In terms of scalability, it offers fewer advantages for maintenance Pros and Cons of Procedural Programming # Pros # Program directly without creating objects or classes Create functions for needed features to call and reuse instead of copy-pasting Easy to trace program flow Cons # Difficult to modify due to tight coupling between code sections (high cohesion makes additions and modifications difficult) Difficult to debug (error checking) Pros and Cons of Object-Oriented Programming # Pros # Easier maintenance through modularization and encapsulation Code is easier to understand due to similarity with the real world Objects themselves are self-contained programs that can be reused in other programs Cons # Most object-oriented programs tend to be relatively slower and use more memory Requires significant time in the design phase to make code understandable through real-world analogies There\u0026rsquo;s No Right Answer! Use the Right Tool for the Job # When to Use Procedural Programming # Typically used when the project scope is small and there\u0026rsquo;s little need for code reuse.\nBenefits:\nThe program itself is lighter Requires less development time and personnel compared to object-oriented approach When to Use Object-Oriented Programming # For large-scale projects where code needs to be reused, object-oriented programming is suitable (excluding initial development costs).\nBenefits:\nMore stable from a maintenance perspective Conclusion # Today we explored object-oriented programming and procedural programming. While I don\u0026rsquo;t yet have deep knowledge of these topics, by researching various sources, I\u0026rsquo;ve gained a broad understanding of object-oriented and procedural programming. Next time, I\u0026rsquo;ll dive deeper into these concepts!
